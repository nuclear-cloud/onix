If there are multiple sources for the same raw material, repeat <ProductFormFeature> for each plot or use the ‘list of plots’ option below. Further repeats of <ProductFormFeature> may be used for multiple paper, card and board types. <ProductFormFeatureValue> is a country code from List 91 indicating the country in which the source plot is, optionally followed by a space and the name of the species, and optionally followed by a space and the date of harvest of the source plot (YYYY, YYYYMM or YYYYMMDD). A species name may itself consist of the binomial Latin name (the ‘scientific name’), or the binomial Latin name followed by a space plus the common name in parentheses. The common name may only be included if the Latin name is also present. Alternatively, a list of multiple species names from the same source plot may be listed, separated by commas. In such a list, all species names must include both scientific and common name, or all must include a scientific name only. Note there can be up to four types of data (country, a Latin name and a common name, or a comma-separated list of Latin names and common names, and a date), each space separated, but only the country is mandatory. <ProductFormFeatureDescription> is a list of points defining one or more plots from which the raw material was harvested, using GPS coordinates with 6 decimal places of precision (these are real numbers, ±90 for latitude [negative numbers indicate a latitude south of the equator], ±180 excluding -180 itself for longitude [negative numbers indicate a longitude west of the Prime Greenwich meridian]). Latitude and Longitude for each point are space-separated, and multiple points are comma-separated. Multiple plots are semicolon separated, and must be in the same country. (Any supplied species name and date must also apply to all plots in the list.) (Note these GPS coordinates use decimal parts of a degree, not minutes and seconds.) ONE point defines the center of a 4 hectare plot (200m × 200m). TWO points define a line joining opposite corners of a ‘square’ plot bounded by two lines of latitude and two of longitude. THREE or more points define a simple polygon outlining the plot. Plot types with one, two or multiple points must not be mixed in a list of multiple plots. Lines and polygon edges may not cross a national boundary or the 180° line of longitude. Polygon edges may not intersect. It is good practice to ensure the polygon is drawn clockwise and is ‘closed’ (that is, that the first and last points are identical, so that for example four points define a triangle). If not closed, the closing polygon edge is implied, and to avoid ambiguity, trailing zeros in the latitude and longitude should be explicit. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later",
